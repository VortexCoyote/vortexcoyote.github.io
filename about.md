I'm a game programmer who's mostly interested in tools development and back-end development in general. 

My main interest in tools, engine and back-end development stems from my love of cooperating with and helping other people. I like building and designing big systems with user-friendly interfaces that can potentially streamline the game development process. 

[Here](../assets/resume.pdf) is my resume.
