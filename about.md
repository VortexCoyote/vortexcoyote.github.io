I'm a game programmer who's mostly interested in tools development, but also back-end development in general. 

I like cooperating, communicating with and helping other people, which is where my interest in tools development comes from. A part of that is also present in my interest in back-end development, since I love to build and design big systems with simple and userfriendly interfaces for other to use!

[Here](../assets/resume.pdf) is my resume.
